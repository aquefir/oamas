-----

1. Install Slick.

1.1. Installing on Arch Linux

Use the AUR if possible, the package name is ‘slick’. Otherwise, follow the
generic instructions for other Unices below.

1.2. Installing on macOS, *BSD, et cetera

Download the sources from <https://github.com/aquefir/slick/releases>, and
run ‘util/install.sh’ with a POSIX-compatible shell.

2. Install libraries.

2.1. Installing Hinterlib on Arch Linux

Use the AUR if possible, the package name is ‘hinterlib’. Otherwise, follow
the generic instructions for other Unices below. The minimum release is 1.4.1.

2.2. Installing Hinterlib on macOS, *BSD, et cetera

Download Hinterlib from <https://github.com/aquefir/hinterlib/releases>, and
run ‘common/util/install.sh’ with a POSIX-compatible shell. The $PREFIX
variable can be overridden as desired and defaults to ‘/usr/local’.

2.3. Other libraries

OAMAS™ requires a working OpenGL runtime with support for OpenGL ES 2.0. It
uses an instance of GLAD to this end. As long as GLES 2.0 ought to be present,
no action is required to detect or integrate it.

3. Run make.

The Makefile will get everything it needs via Slick. Job control is
supported if parallelisation is desired.
