1. Install Slick.

1.1. Installing on Arch Linux

Use the AUR if possible, the package name is ‘slick’. Otherwise, follow the
generic instructions for other Unices below.

1.2. Installing on macOS, *BSD, et cetera

Download the sources from <https://github.com/aquefir/slick/releases>, and
run ‘util/install.sh’ with a POSIX-compatible shell.

2. Run make.

The Makefile will get everything it needs from Slick. Job control is
supported if parallelisation is desired.
